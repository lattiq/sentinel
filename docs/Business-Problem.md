# 🎯 Business Problem & Solution

## The Core Challenge

**LattIQ** supplies **machine learning feature columns** to data consumer clients who integrate this feature data into their RDS PostgreSQL databases. However, LattIQ has **no visibility** into how clients actually use this data once it's in their infrastructure, creating critical business risks:

### Primary Concerns

1. **🔄 Unauthorized Data Replication**

   - Clients could create unauthorized replicas of databases containing LattIQ's valuable feature data
   - Risk of distribution beyond agreed partnership scope through read replicas, backups, or CDC streams

2. **⚠️ Data Misuse and Abuse**

   - Bulk extraction of LattIQ feature data for purposes beyond legitimate business needs
   - Systematic data mining to reverse-engineer LattIQ's algorithms
   - Using dump utilities or COPY operations to export complete datasets

3. **📋 Compliance Visibility Gap**
   - No way to verify clients are adhering to data usage agreements
   - Unable to audit data access patterns or detect unauthorized access
   - Legal and business relationship risks from lack of oversight

### Specific Abuse Scenarios Detected

**Scenario 1: Database Replication**

```
Client creates a read replica of their production database and uses it for
analytics or provides access to third parties, effectively giving unauthorized
access to LattIQ's feature data.
```

**Scenario 2: Systematic Data Extraction**

```sql
-- Attacker's systematic approach (detected by Sentinel):
SELECT feature_col1, feature_col2, feature_col3 FROM customer_table
WHERE created_date > '2024-01-01' ORDER BY id LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 0;
SELECT feature_col1, feature_col2, feature_col3 FROM customer_table
WHERE created_date > '2024-01-01' ORDER BY id LIMIT 10000 OFFSET 10000;
-- Pattern continues systematically...
```

**Scenario 3: Backup Misuse**

```
Client takes a database backup "for disaster recovery" but actually restores
it in a development environment where unauthorized users can access LattIQ's
proprietary feature data.
```

**Scenario 4: Third-Party Data Sharing**

```
Client sets up change data capture to stream updates to LattIQ feature columns
to an external analytics platform, effectively sharing LattIQ's real-time data
with unauthorized parties.
```

## Technical Challenges

- **Multi-Table Distribution**: LattIQ features may be distributed across multiple tables
- **Infrastructure Constraints**: Cannot deploy new components in client environments
- **Scale Variability**: Feature count varies from handful to hundreds of columns per client
- **Detection Sophistication**: Must distinguish legitimate usage from systematic abuse
